Coding Dojo Django / Python assignment "Login and Registration" 

<strong>Assignment: Login and Registration</strong>
Rebuild the Login and Registration assignment from the flask chapter, this time using Django.

Weâ€™ve learned how to integrate models, validations, and controllers to our projects. Our next goal is to create a fully functional login and registration app! This will combine your knowledge of MVC patterns, validations, and password encryption.


<strong>Build the following:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Show validation error messages if validations fail the following tests</li>
        <ul>
            <li>First Name - Required; No fewer than 2 characters; letters only</li>
            <li>Last Name - Required; No fewer than 2 characters; letters only</li>
            <li>Email - Required; Valid Format</li>
            <li>Password - Required; No fewer than 8 characters in length; matches Password Confirmation</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Don't worry about hashing passwords for now. We'll take a closer look at hashing tomorrow.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Bonus:</strong> Birthday Field - Before today, or go creative and do it in an age range
<strong>Bonus:</strong> Implement Flash Messages

One thing we've noticed as people build their login and registrations that you should consider:

<strong>User.objects.get(email = email)</strong>
If there is not a matching email for a .get(), Django throws an error (try and except could come in handy), otherwise it returns the User object associated with the matching user. e.g. Userobject.

<strong>User.objects.filter(email = email)</strong>
Filter, on the other hand, returns a list, so if there is no user that matches, it returns an empty list.  If there is a single matching user the list will contain a single User object: e.g. [Userobject].
